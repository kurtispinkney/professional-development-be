    "bio":"I began my career as an atmospheric scientist and used Python to complete my course work and thesis research. Leveraging the programming skills I developed in college, I stumbled my way into a role as a scientific programmer where I've been exposed to a world of project requirements and processes running in production environments. As a result I've dedicated a lot of time, on and off the clock, learning about development best practices and incorporating those lessons learned into my work.",
    "bio_personal": "In my free time, I've taken to working on a pet project to refine my programming skills and to play with new tools and technologies. Outside of programming, though, I enjoy playing flag football and backpacking with my fiancee and dog. My fiancee also loves plants and gardening, so I've also been recruited to build various plant shelves and boxes as needed to sustain her grow operation. If you're interested in learning more about me feel free to get in touch with me or download my resume for a deeper dive into my professional skills.",

I work heavily with Python and orchestrate the workflows using Argo to run on Kubernetes clusters, monitoring job statistics stored in InfluxDB and visualized on Grafana dashboards. I've worked my way into a team lead position where I lead a team of 7-9 developers of varying skill levels in the development and implementation of these workflows. Recently, I've also been leading the development of multiple Python packages that will allow us to get rid of countless lines of duplicate code and decrease development times. Through these projects I've been able to introduce concepts such as unit testing and continuous integration that will be useful as our team tranisitions to a more services oriented architecture and DevOps culture."
